# Ways to Collaborate on Group Problems
There are many ways to collaborate on group problems. Here we offer several options and suggestions. Whatever approach you take make sure it is working for everyone in your group and try to be adaptable.


+ [Explain Everything](https://explaineverything.com/){:target="_blank"}<br>
    Many of you may be familiar with Explain Everything from Physics 23. The shared whiteboarding features allow you to work together on the same whiteboard. To get started one person needs to create a free account and choose the "start whiteboarding" option. You will then need to press the invite button in the top right and provide the appropriate code to your collaborators. Don't forget to press start. Everyone will then be able to work on the whiteboard. Explain Everything has its own audio features but you may find it simplest to keep those muted and rely on the zoom breakout room for audio in which case you should make sure to mute the microphone within the Explain Everything app. Relying on the zoom audio will make it easier for you to reach out to the instructors and grutors. For uploading assignments, it is possible to export files 


+  **Pen and paper**<br>
    Pen and paper always works. To share work you might find it helpful to have whatever you normally use to scan and submit your work readily available and to share progress by exchanging pictures rather than holding a picture up to a camera. This can also be used in combination with some of the other approaches if different members of your group have different prefences - i.e. many of the whiteboarding applications such as Explain Everything will take and import pictures from directly within the app.

+ [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) <br>
    Google Jamboard is another shared whiteboarding app. It is part of the gsuite packagae and available by logging in through your g.hmc.edu account. Sharing a whiteboard uses the share button at the top right analogous to sharing a Google doc.

+ **Zoom whiteboard** <br>
    Within Zoom itself you can choose the sharescreen option and share a whiteboard. This has less functionality than some of the previous whiteboarding options but also less overhead to get going.

+ **Camera Showing Your Workspace**
    Another method of collaborating in real time without writing on a screen is to use an external camera mounted in a way that shows your writing in real time. This takes a bit of effort to set-up but some people find it works reasonably well.

A note on technology: Most of these whiteboarding apps are significantly easier to write on with a tablet with a stylus than with a computer trackpad. Some can also be resource intensive and their ease of use may depend on your computer speed and internet bandwidth. Please be considerate of whether everyone at hand has the resources at hand to collaborate effectively with a given method. If you don't have access to a tablet but think being able to write on a screen would help you to get more out of the collaborative excercises, you might consider a USB graphic tablet, such as a Turcom TS-6610 or Deco Mini 7 from XP-Pen. These work essentially as a mouse that you activate with a pressure-sensitive “pen”, allowing you to write on an opaque surface. Because the writing does not show up where the pen tip meets the tablet, but on the computer screen, it takes a bit of getting used to. However, these devices cost only about $60. Make sure to get one big enough to have plenty of room to write—at least 10-inches (25 cm) wide.
