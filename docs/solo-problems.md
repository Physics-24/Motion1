# Solo Problems
### (due Sundays at noon)

[Jump to this week's problems](#bottom)

The solo problems are timed and closed book, closed notes. You have 30 minutes to complete each question. Opening a question starts the 30 minute timer for that question, so we recommend that you start and submit one problem at a time. 

Solo problems are overall worth 15% of your total grade, therefore each solo problem is only worth a small fraction of your overall grade. The solo problems are a chance for you to regularly assess your mastery of each week's material, with much lower stakes than the midterm and final examinations. You also get to drop your lowest 6 solo problems for the semester, so if you're having an off day, no problem, just try your best (whatever that might look like today).

Solo problems become available each Thursday  at noon and the submission window closes on Sunday  at noon. Each solo problem is due 30 minutes after you first access it (fixed time limit), so please make sure that you are in a test-like environment before you click on any of the links below -- i.e. you have a quiet, cleared off work area, and you have access to a method of uploading your submission to Gradescope after you finish. If you run into difficulty uploading your submission, please send it to Prof. Ilton immediately by email. You do not have to complete both of the week's solo problems in one sitting.
