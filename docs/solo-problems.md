# Solo Problems
### (due Sundays at noon)

[Jump to this week's problems](#bottom)

The solo problems are timed and closed book, closed notes. You have 30 minutes to complete each question. Opening a question starts the 60 minute timer for that question. The 60 minute window gives you extra time to download/print/upload your submission in Gradescope. But please set a 30 minute timer for yourself once you are ready to start each question: you may only spend 30 minutes on each question. We recommend you open only one question at a time. Only click on the link for the second problem after you have finished uploading your submission for the first problem. 

Solo problems are overall worth 15% of your total grade, therefore each solo problem is only worth a small fraction of your overall grade. The solo problems are a chance for you to regularly assess your mastery of each week's material, with much lower stakes than the midterm and final examinations. You also get to drop your lowest 6 solo problems for the semester, so if you're having an off day, no problem, just try your best (whatever that might look like today).

Solo problems become available each Thursday at noon and the submission window closes on Sunday at 12pm (noon). Each solo problem is due 60 minutes after you first access it (but only 30 minutes can be spent working on the problem), so please make sure that you are in a test-like environment before you click on any of the Gradescope links below -- i.e. you have a quiet, cleared off work area, and you have access to a method of uploading your submission to Gradescope after you finish. If you run into difficulty uploading your submission, please send it to phys-24-instructors-l@g.hmc.edu immediately by email. You do not have to complete both of the week's solo problems at the same time (e.g. you could complete one on Friday and the other on Saturday).
