# Solo Problems
### (due Saturdays at 9pm PT)

The solo problems are timed and closed book, closed notes. You have one hour to complete each question. Opening a question starts the one hour timer for that question, so we recommend that you start and submit one problem at a time. 

Solo problems are worth 20% of your total grade.
