## Representing Position as a Vector

observer O and point P

coordinate system (Cartesian x,y); refer to objects coordinates (x,y)= ( $$\sqrt(3)$$ , 1 ) m

in Ph24 heavily use vectors (magnitude and direction)

position vector extends from the observer to the object

notation $$\vec{r}_{P,O}$$ - position of P with respect to O; vectors symbols  always represented by over arrows in this course

often we will drop these subscripts when the object & observer are obvious

in other contexts you might have seen the notation $$\vec{r}_{P,O} = (x,y)$$ - i.e. representing the vector by its coordinate pairs in a standard Cartesian basis; but in Ph24 we will often choose a non-standard basis (tilted Cartesian, Polar) so we will be explicit

Ph24 notation - basis vectors $$\hat{x}$$ and $$\hat{y}$$ point along the x and y coordinate axes; unit vectors so they have a length of 1. 

Warning: physicists (your instructors and graders included) tend to be picky with vector notation. make sure that vectors are labeled with arrows or hats, and non vectors (scalars or components) are not. Never assign a vector = scalar!

We can then write our position vector in terms of our x hat and y hat basis vectors

the x-component of position ($$r_x$$ or equivalently $$x$$) times the x hat basis vector plus the y component times the y hat basis vector -- and maybe you have a z direction coming out of the page

We can also represent a vector by its length (magnitude) and an angle it makes with the x-axis (direction).

Length of the position vector - a few different notations. I use single bars. Many people prefer the no vector sign to represent the length of a vector. But I prefer not to because it looks similar to a component which can be negative, but the length of a vector can't be negative. So the vertical bars remind me of this fact when I'm working through the algebra. Sum of the squares of the components.

Calculating the angle, use trigonometry.

For   a 2D vector we need two of: x, y component angle and magnitude to completely describe it. if you know two, you can calculate the others. Often we are given magnitude and angle, so let's go through that example here. 

Let's use this same position vector with  magnitude of 2 m and angle of 30 degrees. How do we represent this in our x^ y^ basis?

Express the vector as a length cos angle the vector makes with the x axis in the xhat direction plus the vectors length
