## About this course

To make the most out of our synchronous time together, our weekly class meetings (M/W recitation; Tu/Th whole class) are focused on collaborative problem solving activities. This means that you are responsible for reading/watching the weekly course content before the start of each week. To make digesting this content easier, each week is broken up into smaller sections, and you will complete guided "miniquestions" after each section. 

At the end of each week, you are responsible for completing two closed-book, closed-note, time-constrained problems ("Solo Problems") related to that week's material. Our primary method to assess performance in this course is with a closed-book final exam. We view the ability to apply physical principles to independently solve problems as one of the primary goals of this course. The weekly solo problems provide you with the chance to more frequently practice this skill, and check your understanding as you complete each week.

 
To get started, first read over the course syllabus which contains important information about course policies. Then, start by diving in to the first week's content using the "Weekly Content (Sun)" tab in the side menu.

If you have any logistical questions, please post them up on our class Piazza page: https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2021/phys24
