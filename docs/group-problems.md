# Group Problems
### (Tuesdays/Thursdays in class)

During scheduled class time, 9:35 am - 10:50 am PT on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you will be randomly assigned into a group of 3-4 students to complete two Group Problems. One member of each group will submit a good copy of their group's solutions on Gradescope before 11am PT. You will receive a score for completing the problems and feedback from a grader (the score is based only on a good-faith effort by your group, not on getting the correct answer).  Group problems are worth 10% of your total grade. 

### In-class logistics

For our Group Problems, our aim is to not make this feel like a stressful, rushed time together. Although your group might not get through both problems, you will get full-credit for submitting a good-faith effort. 

Please arrive on time. This will help us sort out the breakout room logistics. 

Start by downloading the template for the Group Problems on Gradescope (linked below). 

**When you get in your break-out room**, decide as a group how you are going to collaborate:

-  what technology will you group use (see [this helpful guide](ways-to-collaborate-on-group-problems){:target="_blank"} for suggestions) 
-  any style preferences (e.g. talking every step through together, or taking 5 minutes alone and then discussing) -- **be communicative, flexible, and helpful** 
- Decide who will formally write up each problem for submission (one submission per problem per group)
    
**If your group needs help:**
- clarifying/logistics (short) questions: Please post on [our Piazza Live Q&A](https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2021/phys24){:target="_blank"} (also check if it's already been asked)
    - longer questions (or if you're stuck): "Ask the host for help" through Zoom

**At 10:35am**, whatever you have, start upload process:
+ To upload On Gradescope 
    - Submit then "Add Group Members" - [see Gradescope Help on Group Submissions](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members){:target="_blank"} - if you do not add group members, no one gets credit (including you!)
+ Graded on a "good-faith" effort -- we expect everyone to get 100% -- whatever you submit you will receive feedback on, so there's incentive for you to try your best


Solutions for the group problems are made available on Thursday afternoon. We strongly recommend that you check your answers and understanding of these group problems (and any grader feedback) before attempting the "Timed Solo Problems" at the end of each week.
