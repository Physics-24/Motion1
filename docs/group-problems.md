# Group Problems
### (Tuesdays/Thursdays in class)

During scheduled class time, 9:35 am - 10:50 am PT on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you will be randomly assigned into a group of three students to complete two Group Problems. One member of each group will submit a good copy of their group's solutions on Gradescope before 11am PT. Group problems are worth 10% of your total grade. 

Solutions for the group problems are made available on Thursday afternoon. We strongly recommend that you check your answers and understanding of these group problems (and any grader feedback) before attempting the "Timed Solo Problems" at the end of each week.
