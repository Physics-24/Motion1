# Group Problems (Tuesdays/Thursdays)

During scheduled class time, 9:35 am - 10:50 am PT on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you will be randomly assigned into a group of three students to complete 2-3 Group Problems. One member of each group will submit a good copy of their group's solutions on Gradescope. Group problems are worth 20% of your total grade. Each week, graders will carefully grade one question from that week, with the remaining questions graded for completeness. 

Solutions for the group problems are made available on Thursday afternoon. We strongly recommend that you check your answers and understanding of these group problems before attempting the "Timed Solo Problems" at the end of each week.
