# Week 2: Jan 31 - Feb 6

<br>

**The miniquestions for all of the topics on this page are due on Monday February 7 at 7am PT.**


<br>

This week we are digging into Newton's Laws of Motion. We are taking Newton's Laws for individual point masses (particles)as our given first principles starting point. From these first principles, we will show that macroscopic objects also obey a version of Newton's Laws described by their center-of-mass (CM) motion. 

An important concept emerging from Newton's laws is the conservation of momentum, which we will explicitly practice using this week. Also, in describing the center-of-mass of continuous mass distributions, we will need to use some multi-variable integration that you learned in MATH 19.

## Topics

4. [Using Newton's 1st law](#4-using-newtons-1st-law)
    + conservation of total momentum (e.g. collisions)
    + when does the center-of-mass position not move? 
5. [Calculating the center-of-mass position $$\vec{R}_{CM}$$](#5-calculating-the-center-of-mass-position)
    + discrete mass distributions (summation)
    + continuous mass distributions (integration)
